Installation
============

To install oneFEM, you can use `pip`:
pip install onefem


Alternatively, if you prefer to install the package locally, you can clone the repository and run:
python setup.py install


For more details, check the `requirements.txt` file for additional dependencies.

Usage
=====
To use oneFEM, you first need to create a model file. Once the model is ready, you can run it with the command:
oneFEM /path/to/your/model.py


For more information on running models and using the package, please refer to the usage documentation.

Examples
========

You can find a variety of examples in the `examples/` directory of the project. Below is a basic example:

```python
# Example of a basic oneFEM model

from onefem import Model

# Create a model
model = Model(path_to_model="path/to/your/model.py")

# Run the model
model.run()


This will run the model specified by path_to_model and initiate any required analysis.
